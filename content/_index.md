## Funding Perl and Raku development

The Perl and Raku Foundation accepts donations from organizations that depend on Perl or
Raku, and from individuals who love programming with the Perl or Raku
languages. Our desire is to build a strong, healthy and sustainable language
ecosystem and community.

If you use Perl or Raku to support your business, or as a hobby, your donation
will help fund projects and events that support continued development. Check out [our
prospectus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQJfIW0u-4gKw1o-f18GyyPdT3YlwrUv/view).


## Donate

Your generous donations help to fund TPRF grant programs. Thinking of [becoming
a donor](donate.html)?

## TPRF Grants

Our [grant programs](grants.html) help fund development of open source projects to benefit
Perl, Raku and the broader Community. These grants are funded by donations and
help support open source developers.

## Events

Open source development is driven by in-person events where developers share
ideas, code, and have fun.

The Foundation helps to sponsor many events, worldwide, each year. Find out more on our [events page](/events.html).
