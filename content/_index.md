## Keeping Critical Infrastructure Alive

Perl powers SUSE's OpenQA testing framework, builds Kubernetes packages, and runs price comparison platforms that started 25 years ago and are still going strong.

We fund the developers who fix critical bugs, modernize core features, and keep Perl and Raku competitive so that the companies, contractors, and hobbyists who depend on them can keep building. Whether these languages run your business or fuel your passion projects, your donation directly supports the people actually doing the work.

New to Perl or Raku? [Download and get started](/download.html) with these powerful languages today.

Check out [our prospectus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQJfIW0u-4gKw1o-f18GyyPdT3YlwrUv/view) to see how we've invested in the ecosystem. [Join companies](donate.html) like [DuckDuckGo](https://www.perl.com/article/duckduckgo-donates-25-000-to-the-perl-and-raku-foundation-v2025/), SUSE, and Fastmail in sustaining the Perl and Raku ecosystem.

## Our Grants in Action

Our [grant programs](grants.html) fund development of projects to benefit Perl, Raku and the broader Community. These grants are funded by donations and support open source developers.

## Join Our Community

Connect with fellow Perl and Raku developers in the [TPRF Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/perlfoundation/shared_invite/zt-3ocbigsn5-Cj7aslwG5gtbj8PDrBbeOA). Get help, share your projects, and participate in discussions about the future of Perl and Raku.

## Community Happens Face-to-Face

The Perl and Raku Conference is the annual North American gathering where developers share code, solve problems together, and build the relationships that keep open source thriving. In 2025, we also supported the [London Perl Workshop](https://www.londonperlworkshop.com/) and the [Perl Toolchain Summit](https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2025/), where maintainers collaborate on the infrastructure that powers CPAN and the tools that thousands depend on.

[See upcoming events](/events.html) and find your people.
