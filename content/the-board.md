## Board members

### Stuart Mackintosh, President

Based in Europe, Stuart has been working with free and open source software since the mid-1990s, with many early projects based on Perl delivering e-commerce, ISP and communications services.

Stuart founded various open source integration and hosting companies and currently consults through Open Digital Consulting. He also founded the industry association OpenUK, works with the European Commission, and serves on the governance working group for the Odoo Community Association.

Stuart joined the Foundation because Perl enabled him to solve many business data challenges throughout his career. He believes those who have built careers in digital technology should give back to the communities that enabled them, either financially or by sharing experience and time. He is proud to be working with the Perl communities and excited to be working with the rapidly developing Raku language.

In his role as President, Stuart is keen to develop committees and engagement with the Perl and Raku communities, as well as sponsors and other foundations. He believes it is important to improve the security of these ecosystems and their long-term usefulness and relevance.

Appointed: September 2019
