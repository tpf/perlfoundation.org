around the Perl and Raku programming languages. We encourage you to contribute to our ecosystem
by:

- Joining your local [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org/) group
- Visit [PerlMonks](http://perlmonks.org/)
- Attend a [YAPC](http://www.yapc.org/) in your region of the world
- Join the [TPRF Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/perlfoundation/shared_invite/zt-3ocbigsn5-Cj7aslwG5gtbj8PDrBbeOA)
- See how to [join the TPRF Board](/join-the-board.html)

There are many other ways you can contribute to Perl and Raku including:

- Contribute and maintain a module on the CPAN
- Participate in the development, maintenance and documentation of
  Perl 5 and Raku.
- Another important way you can contribute to Perl, both as a
  language and as a community, is to make a tax-deductible
  [donation to the Perl Foundation](/donate.html).
- [Sponsor an event, activity or grant](/how-do-sponsors-benefit.html)
