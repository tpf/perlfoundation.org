## FOSDEM Community dinner information


TPRF sponsor the FOSDEM Perl and Raku community dinner which is is traditionally held on the Saturday evening. All food is included and guests are free to purchase their own drinks.

### Pre-ordering

As this is quite a large group, our selected venue requests that we advise of our food order ahead of time so preparations can be made. They generally accommodate minor changes on the evening and will re-confirm our order at the table. 


### Full details for 2026

Full details and menu will be posted here.:
