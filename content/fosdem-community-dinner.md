## FOSDEM Community dinner


TPRF sponsor the FOSDEM community dinner which is is traditionally held on the Saturday evening. All food is included and guests are free to purchase their own drinks.

This page links to the menu, instructions on how to reserve your place and other useful information.

### Pre-ordering

As this is quite a large group, the venue requests that we advise of our food order ahead of time so preparations can be made. They generally accommodate minor changes on the evening and will re-confirm our order at the table. 


### Full details for 2026

Full details will be posted here.
